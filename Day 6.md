## Some things about python
- - -

Learning python for me is to achieve my dream.   
When I first contact programming , I learning C for my first programming language.  
But when I was a freshman , I find learn a programing is too hard for me.  
So my first C prongramming language lesson hadn't get a good grade.  
It make me very sad , but I think failure is the mother of success.  
And the next year , I learn C programming language again.  
I remember the code of the question , but when I was in examination room ,I find I can't find where code is wrong , so the second examination I also failed , it make me very sad.  
When I was a junior , I find learning C programming language is very good.
Of course , it is relevant my summer vaction experience.
Now ,I begin to learn python programming language in my remaining college time.  
It's my programming languge learning career.
